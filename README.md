# Virtuali_assistant-using-Html-css-Javascript
A simple yet functional virtual assistant project developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The virtual assistant interacts with users and performs specific tasks based on commands, such as opening YouTube or navigating to other web pages.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly design for smooth interaction.
- **Command Execution**: Processes user input to execute specific actions.
- **Dynamic Responses**: Real-time feedback based on commands entered.
- **Browser Actions**: Opens web pages like YouTube based on user commands.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the application interface.
- **CSS3**: For styling and making the interface visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For adding logic and enabling interactivity.

## How It Works

1. **Input Field**: Users can type commands into the input field.
2. **Command Processing**: JavaScript processes the input and matches it with predefined commands.
3. **Action Execution**: If a command is recognized, the assistant performs the corresponding action (e.g., opens YouTube using the `window.open()` method).
4. **Error Handling**: If the command is not recognized, a friendly message guides the user.
